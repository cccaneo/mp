Multiplicative persistance  
This simple program iterates the product of all digits of a certain number until get one digit  
Example:  

input: 23976  
first iteration: 2x3x9x7x6 = 2268  
second iteration: 2x2x6x8 = 192  
third iteration: 1x9x2 = 18  
fourth iteration: 1x8 = 8  

4 iterations in total!  

The number with the largest amount of iterations ever found is 277777788888899 with 11 iterations!  
Can you find a number with more iterations?
